Points I went for:
Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change its theme/aesthetic (to something other than sci-fi) (50)
Create new artwork for all of the in-game assets (rocket, spaceships, explosion) (25) 
Create a new spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points (25)
Implement parallax scrolling (15)
